		<p>How long can two people talk about nothing? Your shields were failing, sir. Well, that's certainly good to know. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? and attack the Romulans. The unexpected is our normal routine. Travel time to the nearest starbase? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. You enjoyed that. Computer, belay that order. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.</p>

		Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without warp drive could cross in the given time.

		<p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly! We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p>

		Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?

		Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state. The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive, virtually undetectable by your transporter.

		<p>Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. We have a saboteur aboard. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Sorry, Data. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Damage report! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. What? We're not at all alike! I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice.</p>
